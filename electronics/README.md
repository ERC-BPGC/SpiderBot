# Contribution

Feel free to write about anything new you have learnt and implemented in spiderbot electronics. This will help everyone involved in this project.

1. Create a fork of the main repository in your github account.
https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/SpiderBot

2. Clone the `dev` branch using the command
```
git clone -b dev https://github.com/<your-github-username>/SpiderBot.git
```

3. Copy your markdown file into the `/electronics/docs` folder under the appropriate topic. Add the link to your markdown file at the relevant place. 

For example, if you have written about ESP32, name your file `esp32.md` and put it into the docs folder under `microcontrollers`. Then add the link to the file in the microcontrollers page like this.
```
[ESP32](/electronics/docs/esp32.md)
```

4. Commit your changes and push then to the forked repository.

5. Go to the forked repository and create a pull request.
